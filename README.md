# ChristmasProject2019
Small Raspberry Pi Project that runs simple animation in the spirit of Christmas


## Introduction
This project is simply a wrapper around the `GTKMM` Library. I will be working on a Linux x64 Architectures, so most of the features are not guaranteed to work on other architectures. I will be testing other Architectures later on in project. This is still in `Early Stages` so expect more Features as the project progresses 😊. Be sure to report any bugs you encounter! 🐞


## Getting Started
Setting up this project, you will need to clone it then initiate the Sub-Modules like so,

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Ciaxur/GTK-Canvas-Sandbox      # Clones Repository
make init-git-submodules                                    # Initiates Submodules
```
